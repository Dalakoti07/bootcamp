/* .class <tag> {
    apply the properties
} 
It means select all the tag in class and apply these properties

Identify where the same is comming from and make margin or padding zero than
Inline elements have width and size as same as their content, while Block Element take as much space as its parent

Use borders to see the size of the element
em means size of 'm' alphabet in that block or text, so for h1 em is different than 1em for h2 tag
rem means relative em means size of the parent, which is same as the default size of the html body text, 1rem is same for h1 and h2

Mostly used css units are rem and em and percents

block elements have width and height attribute wwhich can set by any of the above mentioned units, ems/rems/% 

for image height %unit doesn't work

images are inline elements, we can make inline element take the dimensions of the parent with the help of display property as inline-block

make a thing at the center always make margin as 0 auto; means 0 margin from top and bottom and divide the margin equally between left and right

float image, if u float than u should clear

making a blog website and want the content at center do width=80%; margin 0 auto;

flex box means boxes aligned side by side to each other

when using box make sure to clear otherwise things would break

input: not([type="radio"]) {
    // this would select all the input type class excluding radio class
}
